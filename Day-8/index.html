    <h1>Understanding CSS Selectors</h1>

    <p class="text">
        CSS selectors play an important role in web development. They are used to
        select HTML elements and apply styles to them. Without selectors, it would
        be impossible to control the appearance of a web page efficiently.
    </p>
    <p class="text">
        There are different types of CSS selectors such as element selectors,
        class selectors, ID selectors, and group selectors. Each selector has its
        own purpose and usage depending on the design requirement.

        update in the future.
